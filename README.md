# dynamic-filter-bold-letter

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-bvre8v)

This component displays a list of city names with a search field to filter the list based on input.
The component uses the following Angular features:

- `PipeBolBoldLetterPipe` to highlight letters corresponding to the search
- `combineLatest`, `map`, `mergeMap`, and `startWith` to manage asynchronous data streams
